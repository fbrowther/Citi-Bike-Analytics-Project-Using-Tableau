# Tableau-Citi-Bike-Analytics Project

## Brief Introduction:
The Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). 

As a part of this project, I was required to analyse the chosen data (month/year) to look for significant insights to report. 

## Important questions that was asked included -
    (1) How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
    (2) By what percentage has total ridership grown?
    (3) How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
    (4) What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
    (5) What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
    (6) what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
    (7) How does the average trip duration change by age?
    (8) What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

## Technologies Used -
        Jupiter Notebook
        Tableau Public Server (to publish)
        Tableau Desktop

## Project Split up -
    (1) CitiBike analysis for (the summer month of) September of 2019 - Dashboard and Story 
    (2) CitiBike analysis for September of 2021-22 - Dashboard
    (3) CitiBike analysis for September of pre- and post-Pandemic (2019, 2020, 2021) - Mini Project
    

# CitiBike analysis for September of 2019 - Dashboard and Story

The data was chosen for the month of September, for this part of the project. The selection of this dataset was done (1) to avoid any affects from adverse weather conditions and (2) also to capture what the CitiBike stats have been for this month before the Pandemic hit NewYork.

# CitiBike analysis for September of 2021-22 - Dashboard only

For this part of the analysis, data for the month of September 2021 and 2022 was collected, combined and analysed to see distinct insights that was evident for these post pandemic years. Citibike started to archieve the data for the years 2021 onwards a little bit differently to all the previous years. These changes included no data availability for gender, birthyear information of the riders and tripduration. However, for these two years, Citibike started to archieve information about the type of bike (Classic, Electric, or Docked).

## Limitations of the Project -

(1) Working initially on these projects on tableau public and saving to tableau server was so slow at times.  Sometimes the server crashed only to loose some of the analysed data. The work had to be repeated on Tableau Desktop which allows to save local copies of the files.

(2) The format of data archived by Citi Bike has changed. These changes included no data availability for gender, birthyear and tripduration since 2021. Citibike has now started to archieve information about the type of bike (Classic, Electric, or Docked) from 2021 which came handy for some analysis.
