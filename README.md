## Brief Introduction:
The Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. As a part of this project, it is required to analyse the chosen month/year data and generate multiple dashboards and look for significant insights to report. 

## Important questions that was being asked include -
    (1) How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
    (2) By what percentage has total ridership grown?
    (3) How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
    (4) What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
    (5) What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
    (6) what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
    (7) How does the average trip duration change by age?
    (8) What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
