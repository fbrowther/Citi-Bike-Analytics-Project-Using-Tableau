# Tableau-Citi-Bike-Analytics Project

## Brief Introduction:
The Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). As a part of this project, it was required to analyse the chosen data (month/year) to look for significant insights to report.

## Important questions that was being asked include -
    (1) How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
    (2) By what percentage has total ridership grown?
    (3) How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
    (4) What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
    (5) What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
    (6) what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
    (7) How does the average trip duration change by age?
    (8) What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

## Technologies Used -

## Project Split up -
    (1) CitiBike analysis for the summer month of September of 2019 - Dashboard and Story 
    (2) CitiBike analysis for September of 2021-22 - Dashboard
    (3) CitiBike analysis for September of pre- and post-Pandemic (2019, 2020, 2021) - Mini Project
    

# CitiBike analysis for September of 2019 - Dashboard and Story

The data for the month of September was chosen for this part of the project. The selection of this dataset was done (1) to avoid any affects from adverse weather conditions and (2) also to capture what the CitiBike stats have been for this month before the Pandemic.
